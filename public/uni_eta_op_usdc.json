  "aboutText": "The exchange-traded strategy “ETA” is an ERC-20 structured product built on Optimism Chain that lets you leverage a collateralized debt position (USDC lent on Sonne) to borrow a volatile asset (OP), pair it with USDC stablecoin, and provide OP/USDC liquidity on Uniswap all in one action. This allows earning high APY and hedging against OP volatility. ETS “ETA” keeps track of OP/USDC price changes. There are 3 types of price ranges: wide, narrow, very narrow. ETS “ETA” has narrow price range. It can be changed depending on the market and conditions on it.<br/><br/>The unique feature of ETS “ETA” is that it automatically administers a health factor on Sonne and rebalances your Lent/Borrowed amounts to maintain a stringent Health Factor meaning. Payouts are happening every day and are auto compounded back into the strategy to further amplify rewards.<br/><br/>Users also benefit from minimal gas costs associated with minting, redeeming, and all other DeFi activities because this product is deployed on Optimism - a highly scalable L2 chain.",
  "riskText": "By depositing USDC into this strategy, you are automatically borrowing an equal value of OP from Sonne at a rate roughly equal to the current price of OP denoted above. <br/><br/>The strategy's smart contract is designed to automatically invest these equal values of OP & USDC into Uniswap OP/USDC Liquidity Pool, after which these LP Tokens are staked into the Gauge Pool.",
  "impermanentText": "While the Uniswap pools will accrue transaction fees that generate yields, the pool may become imbalanced; when the user withdraws their investment, the strategy's smart contract may need to use the user's funds to buy additional OP to repay the lent amount (plus interest), which can result in a net loss from the initial deposit.",
  "ammText": "The strategy's smart contract automatically moves your deposit into the said Automated Market Maker (i.e., Uniswap) and, in doing so, may incur an AMM’s smart contract risk.<br/><br/>By depositing funds into this smart contract, a user understands and agrees to the strategies to which it will invest underlying assets.",
  "importantText": "Yield/APY is not guaranteed and can be highly variable depending on the volume and rewards from the underlying AMM as well as the price of a volatile asset (OP). Farmers may incur net losses if the impermanent loss is more significant than the yield earned."
