  "cardTitle": "Generate yield on WBNB-BUSD pool by hedging your risks and simplify process",
  "aboutText": "The exchange-traded strategy WBNB/BUSD ($WBNBBUSD), is an ERC-20 structured product built on Binance Smart chain that lets you leverage a collateralized debt position (BUSD lent on Venus) to borrow a volatile asset (WBNB), pair it with BUSD stablecoin, and provide WBNB/BUSD liquidity on Cone all in one action. This allows earning high APY and hedging against WBNB volatility.<br/><br/>The unique feature of WBNB/BUSD ETS is that it automatically administers a health factor of 1.20x on Venus and rebalances your Lent/Borrowed amounts to maintain a stringent 1.20x Health Factor. Payouts are happening every day and are auto compounded back into the strategy to further amplify rewards. This product might occasionally produce negative rebases, which will not be compensated.",
  "riskText": "By depositing USD+ into this strategy, you automatically borrow WBNB from Venus at a market rate.<br/><br/>The strategy's smart contract is designed to automatically invest these equal values of WBNB and BUSD into Cone's WBNB/BUSD Liquidity Pool, after which these LP Tokens are staked into the Gauge Pool on Unknown",
  "impermanentText": "Due to trading activities with the WBNB/BUSD pair on Cone and/or WBNB price change, the pool may become imbalanced, which can cause rebalance of a user’s LP position, resulting in increased or decreased number of WBNB vs. borrowed in a position. When a user withdraws their investment, the strategy's smart contract may need to use a user's funds to buy additional WBNB to repay the lent amount (plus interest), which can result in a net loss from the initial deposit.",
  "ammText": "The strategy's smart contract automatically moves your deposit into the said Automated Market Maker (i.e., Cone) and, in doing so, may incur an AMM’s smart contract risk.<br/><br/>By depositing funds into this smart contract, a user understands and agrees to the strategies to which it will invest underlying assets.",
  "importantText": "Yield/APY is not guaranteed and can be highly variable depending on the volume and rewards from the underlying AMM as well as the price of a volatile asset (WBNB). Farmers may incur net losses if the impermanent loss is more significant than the yield earned."
